Lena, Dina, Linda & Lee Wishes:
===============================

Necessary for improved playability:
----------------------------------
* be able to drag numbers to box or be able to type with number pad
* no graphics errors -- cursor image being removed again with moving
* different color for numbers that were already there
* errors for impossible moves

Would be nice to have:
----------------------
* highlight all of one number on the board
* difficulty adjustment
* hint option
